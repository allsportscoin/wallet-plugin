Dear SOC Wallet Users,

There have been several instances of high-profile legitimate websites such as SOC Manager and Games Workshop that have had their websites temporarily compromised. This involves showing a fake SOC Wallet window on the page asking for user's seed phrases. SOC Wallet will never open itself in this way and users are encouraged to report these instances immediately to either or our support email.

Please read our full article on this ongoing issue.
